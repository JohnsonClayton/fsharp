This is a repository for the CSCI330: Programming Languages course. Our group is exploring F#.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found [here](https://fsharp.org/)

### Compiling and Executing Code
If we have an example F# file `test.fsx`, then we would compile and run the file like this:  
```
$ dotnet fsi hello.fsx
```
#### Creating a Project from Terminal

If we want to create a project in a given directory, we run the following:  
```
$ dotnet new console --language F#
$ dotnet run
```
